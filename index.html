    <h2 class="section-heading">About the novella</h2>
    <p><em>Necessary Cuts</em> follows a boy growing up in the rural South — on a fish hatchery above a lake, then a farmhouse full of snakes, then a series of small towns where nothing quite fits. His father collects animal bones and is slowly fading away. His mother holds everything together until she can't. And a skeleton raccoon keeps showing up at the worst possible moments, carrying gifts no one asked for.</p>
    <p>It's a story about the places you're from and the ones that get taken from you. About watching a parent disappear in slow motion. About the things that stay with you — not because you chose them, but because they chose you.</p>
    <p><em>Necessary Cuts</em> is the winner of the <a href="https://sites.miamioh.edu/miami-university-press/">2026 Miami University Press Novella Prize</a> and will be published by Miami University Press.</p>
